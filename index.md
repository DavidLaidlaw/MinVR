###Introduction

MinVR is an open-source cross-platform virtual reality library initially developed at the University of Minnesota [Interactive Visualization Lab](http://ivlab.cs.umn.edu). It supports interaction with multiple VR input devices and display configurations (e.g. fish-tank VR displays, powerwalls, and CAVE systems), while allowing for integration with a variety of graphics toolkits (e.g. raw OpenGL, G3D, Glut, OpenSceneGraph, etc.).

###MinVR Features and Design 

Core Library Features:
- window configuration
- stereo output for various display devices
- input device configuration
- input events for VR, multi-touch, and other non-keyboard, mouse, joystick events based on VRPN
- setting up head tracking and appropriate projection matrices   
- multi-threaded rendering with support for multiple graphics windows (i.e., multiple graphics contexts), one per thread
